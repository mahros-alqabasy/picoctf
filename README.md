## Installation 0

### Clone the Repository and Install the Tool Globally

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/mahros-alqabay/picoctf.git
cd picoctf-tool
chmod +x picoctf
sudo mv picoctf /usr/local/bin/
~~~

---

## Usage

Run the tool using the **picoctf** command followed by a subcommand. Available subcommands are: `flag`, `find`, `format`.

---

## Commands

### Wrap a Flag (`flag`)

Wrap the input in the `picoCTF{}` format.

#### Examples:

**From a direct string:**

~~~bash
picoctf flag "example_flag"
~~~

**Output:**

~~~bash
picoCTF{example_flag}
~~~

**From a file:**

~~~bash
picoctf flag file.txt
~~~

**From a pipeline:**

~~~bash
echo "example_flag" | picoctf flag
~~~

---

### Find a Flag (`find`)

Extract the first `picoCTF{...}` flag from the input.

#### Examples:

**From a direct string:**

~~~bash
picoctf find "random text picoCTF{flag}"
~~~

**From a file:**

~~~bash
picoctf find file.txt
~~~

**From a pipeline:**

~~~bash
cat file.txt | picoctf find
~~~

---

### Format Input (`format`)

Format input text by removing spaces and normalizing capitalization for the picoCTF format.

#### Examples:

~~~bash
picoctf format "p i c oCT F {example_flag}"
~~~

---

### Copy to Clipboard (`--copy`)

Add `--copy` to any command to automatically copy the output to the clipboard.

#### Examples:

~~~bash
picoctf find file.txt --copy
picoctf flag "example_flag" --copy
~~~

If the output is invalid (e.g., empty or not in `picoCTF{...}` format), you will receive a warning:

WARNING: The copied text is empty. WARNING: The copied text is not in picoCTF format.
